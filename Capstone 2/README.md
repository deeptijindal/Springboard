## Future Work
As a recommendation for future work, it will be great to include the identifying characteristics such as amenities (swimming pool, gym room, etc), neighboring education facilities (reputable school and universities), and nearest distance to public transportation. These characteristics will help to determine the house price. Based on the characteristics, we could further segmentize the house into two categories, luxury house or ordinary house. A different model can be developed based on the house category.
